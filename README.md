# Dough

This is a simple WinForms app I made for fun that allows the user to track outgoings from bank accounts.

Mainly used to get to better grips with a good foundational architecture of EntityFramework and to have a bit of fun in the meantime!

As of 19/05/23 The user can create accounts and then add outgoings linked to those accounts to track how much is going out from them.
